  <h2 align="center">Nice to e-meet you 🤝🏻</h2>
  <p align="center">
    I'm a fresh graduate from a Le Wagon Istanbul web development bootcamp 🎓 and I am eager to continue my journey into this fascinating world. I am now looking for opportunities to apply my new found skills in  both the back- and the front-end and keep learning by helping innovative individuals or companies to grow and drive positive change

  When I'm not coding, you can find me on my 🚲 or in the ⛰️  or in a 🏕️, preferably in any combination of the three.
